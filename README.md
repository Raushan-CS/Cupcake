Cupcake app
=================================

This app contains an order flow for cupcakes with options for quantity, flavor, and pickup date.
The order details get displayed on an order summary screen and can be shared to another app to
send the order.

The first screen presents the user with three buttons that correspond to the quantity of cupcakes to order.

After selecting the quantity, the app prompts the user to select a cupcake flavor. The app uses what's known as radio buttons to display different options. Users can select one flavor out of a choice of possible flavors.
